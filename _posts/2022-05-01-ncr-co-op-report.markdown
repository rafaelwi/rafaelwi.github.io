excerpt: Reflecting on my winter co-op term at NCR Corporation in Waterloo
---

### Introduction
This post is a reflection on my term working at NCR Corporation in Waterloo. My 
supervisor was Jeewhoon Park, my Team Lead and a Senior Developer.

### About NCR Corporation
NCR Corporation is an American software, consulting, and technology company that
operates in the banking industry. Many of the company’s products are used in
banks and stores, with self-service checkouts, POS terminals, ATM/ABMs, barcode
scanners and more. At the Waterloo office, we primarily focused on the software
that facilitates these products and their uses.

### Job Description
As a Co-op Software Developer under the CSP Foundation application team, our
focus was on primary banking services that are used for transactions by millions
of customers daily. During my term, I developed and implemented new features in
our many microservices, and worked with common industry tools such as Java, 
Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Bash, and Swagger. I also had the 
opportunity to work with internal tools such as API Toolkit, NCR’S 
domain-specific language and framework which accelerates API development. 

This role came with many opportunities that allowed me to improve my skills
in both unit and end-to-end testing, as well as participating in code and test
case reviews, which I first learned about in my classes during the previous 
semesters. To accomplish this, I used JUnit, Cucumber, Jenkins, GitHub, and 
Jira. I also gained new skills in debugging individual microservices and 
multiple microservices together with Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Grafana,
IntelliJ IDEA, and API Toolkit internal tooling. 

A large part of being a Software Developer is being able to adapt and innovate 
as issues and  challenges arise. This role provided me with an opportunity to 
grow and develop my soft skills such as communication, organization, and 
collaboration. I also got to participate in unique opportunities such as helping
hire co-op students for the upcoming work term. 

Working remotely was a unique challenge, especially when adapting to a new role
and work environment. I had to take time to find what worked for me, make sure 
to take breaks, and communicate frequently with my team when I was having 
issues. 


### Work Term Goals
- Learn how to create and deploy containers with Kubernetes and Docker

One of my goals during my work term was to learn about the software and tools 
that are used in the industry that aren't explored in our classes. I focused on
containerization and deployment with Docker and Kubernetes due to its broad use
across the industry.I worked through videos and
tutorials to learn the foundations and then reached out to teammates for
assistance. Since CSP Foundation’s work focuses on microservices, I used these
two technologies on a daily basis and got very comfortable with them.

- Master my documentation skills through Jira and Confluence

Documentation is an important skill in software development that I wanted to
work on, particularly documenting the progress the stories assigned to me. Using
Confluence, I was able to learn about the architecture of the systems developed
by CSP Foundation. With Jira, the team kept track of progress on stories and
epics. These tools were used frequently, especially during our Agile ceremonies,
and I got comfortable with them. I also learned about testing documentation,
which helps to write unit and end-to-end tests faster. 

- Help plan, manage, and lead an Agile Sprint

Agile is an important part of the software development process that I wanted to
get more experience with during my work term. I found that Agile and its
ceremonies are very participatory and that I was quickly involved in the
process. Daily standup meetings were conducted to share our progress on stories
and to bring up and solve issues we encountered. Teams under CSP Foundation
participated in bi-weekly sprint demos where teams share their progress on the
stories they picked up. The beginning of sprints had planning meetings to 
determine what new stories we’d be working on, and retrospectives to reflect on
what went well and what to improve on in the coming sprint.   

### Conclusion
I enjoyed my time at NCR, and my work term was valuable in giving me insight 
into the world of software development. Through working with many new tools and
technologies, it helped me understand what parts of software development
interest me, such as internal tooling, and will help guide me into the next
phase of my journey. 

### Acknowledgements
I’d like to thank all of the people that I met and worked with during my time at
NCR. This includes my teammates on Pi team who helped me resolve issues and get
my work done: Annabelle, Alexandre, Amrit, Balabhaskar (Bala), Lamonte,
Phaneendra (PB), and Zak. I want to give a very special thanks to Jeewhoon for 
being an excellent and patient team lead, supervisor, and mentor. I also wanted 
to thank Kanchana, Gary, Mike, and all the others that I had the opportunity to 
work with. I had an iNCRedible time!
