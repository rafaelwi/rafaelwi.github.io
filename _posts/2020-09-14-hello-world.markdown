Hello World!

Welcome to the redesign of my personal website! I hope you like it. This has 
been the effort of countless nights, lots of planning, and consulting from 
friends and family. From the construction of the [resume page][resume],
which is a recreation of my actual resume, to nitpicking whether margins should
be five pixels or seven, I thank everyone that helped. 

It feels good to strech and work on a personal project after going dormant for
the last few months. I now feel refreshed and ready to tackle new and exciting
things.

I think the best way to commemorate the "remastering" of my personal website
is to write a hello world in the first language that I ever learned, [Turing.][turing]
```
put "Hello world!"
```

That's all for now, hope to see you soon!
