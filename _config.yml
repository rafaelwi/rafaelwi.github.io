user_description: "Hi, I'm Rafael, a Second-Year Software Engineering Student
with a Business Minor at the University of Guelph. I live in the 
Kitchener-Waterloo area. I've been interested in programming ever since I first
played video games such as <i>Super Mario 64</i> and <i>Hey You Pikachu</i>. 
I'm a natural-born tinkerer who loves a good challenge, and I enjoy working in 
groups. 
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy my website and portfolio!"
