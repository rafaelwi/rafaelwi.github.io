excerpt: My reflection on my two terms working under the Ontario Veterinary College (OVC)
---
### Introduction
This post is a reflection on my two terms working under the Ontario Veterinary
College (OVC). I was supervised under Taylor Scully, a Learning Pathways
Officer for students studying Veterinary Medicine.

### About the OVC
The Ontario Veterinary College is a veterinary school located in Guelph, ON, 
on the University of Guelph’s campus. Established in 1862, [the OVC ranked 5th 
in the world for Veterinary Medicine by QS World University Rankings.][ranking]

### Job Description
As Richard Riley, former US Secretary of Education said “as students complete 
their studies they will be doing jobs that do not exist as of today”. This was 
the case for me!

As a Instructional and Technical Support Assistant, my job was to help the OVC 
research and prepare materials, resources, and assets to enable professors and 
faculty to create meaningful and engaging learning experiences for the upcoming 
remote Fall and Winter semesters. 

This role meant that I would be helping to create best practice documents and 
tip sheets to help professors create engaging material for their students, 
create videos and multimedia assets using programs such as Adobe Premiere and 
Articulate 360. I also assisted course design teams in creating and 
proofreading storyboards that were used to redesign labs and seminars for an 
online experience.

A large part of being a Software Engineer is being able to adapt and innovate 
as challenges and issues arise. This role gave me an opportunity to work on my 
soft skills such as communication, organization, and collaboration. In 
addition, I gained a wealth of experience making professional, attractive, and 
concise materials and multimedia lessons for students. I utilized skills from 
my User Interface Design class, such as ghost buttons and using modern 
typefaces to add polish and professionalism to my work.

Working remotely was a unique challenge. I had to adapt to a schedule where I 
worked independently and hold myself accountable. This also meant separating my 
personal and professional life.

### Summer Term Goals
- Complete the certification in *Fundamentals of Course Redesign and Remote 
Pedagogy*

One aspect that motivated me to work for the OVC was being able to receive 
certification in Course Redesign and Remote Pedagogy. By understanding how 
courses are constructed, I can become a better teaching assistant because it 
taught me how students learn and think. In order to accomplish this goal, I had
to plan ahead and set time aside to work on the course and absorb the material.

- Learn new techniques and skills in video editing using Adobe Premiere

One of my hobbies is photo and video editing, so I was excited to build on my 
previous experiences. In the past, I edited videos using Sony Vegas Pro, but I 
wanted to expand my skills to include Adobe Premiere, which is now the 
preferred tool for professionals and hobbyists alike. During the summer, I 
didn’t get an opportunity to do any video editing work due to a lack of demand.
However, I got the opportunity to use Adobe Premiere in the summer.

- Continue to develop my skills in project management

One of my goals for the future is to be a Project Manager in a Software 
Engineering environment. Every industry is integrating software and technology 
into more aspects of their business. By having experience in managing projects 
in a variety of industries, I wanted to understand what priorities non-software
projects have. Accomplishing this goal meant learning more about project 
management, as well as reviewing what I had learned in my Software Design 
classes. 

### Winter Term Goals
- Learn to better communicate concepts through the lessons and labs that I 
create

For this goal, I wanted to implement what I  learned from my remote pedagogy 
course by learning more advanced features of the software that I used, such as 
Articulate. Pursuing this goal allowed me to understand the intricacies and 
features of the software. This allowed me to communicate professors’ messages 
in a clear and concise way.

- Learn how to captivate audiences visually

To accomplish this, I took a Linkedin Learning course about creating visually 
captivating online content. I also wanted to explore other technology that can 
help students learn in captivating ways, but due to time constraints I was not 
able to fully follow my original plan. However, my work saw an improvement over
time.

- Use Software Engineering skills to help contribute to the OVC

As a Software Engineering student, I wanted to apply the skills and knowledge 
that I learned in my classes and adapt them to the needs of the OVC. This meant
using my project management skills from my Software Design classes and user
interface skills from my User Interface Design class. I accomplished this goal
and met my deadlines, making sure that professors had sufficient time to review
the work and request changes as needed, implementing SCRUM-like workflow.

### Conclusion
My work terms at the OVC were unconventional because my role and work that I 
did was brand new to everyone. My work of creating learning tools and 
digitizing course material, helped  to bolster the University of Guelph’s motto
of “Improve Life” by making online learning equal, or in some cases better 
than in-person learning. Many of the professors stated that they will continue
to use my material in the future. 


### Acknowledgements
I’d like to thank all of the people that I met and worked with during my time 
at the OVC. This includes my supervisor Taylor, Dale, Carole, as well as my 
teammates Andrew D., Andrew P., Rabia, O’Neal, and Alim. I’d also like to thank
all of the professors that I worked with during my time at the OVC. I had an 
outstanding time,  and I’m grateful for the op*purr*tunity.
